Designs / text on the floor to tell what level / chapter you are on (e.g. "Sector C")

Pitch black level, can only see 2-block radius around your character

Pushing blocks that can't press goal switches

Lots of enemies / open spaces (don't need to restrict movement)

Keys and locks, or groups of goal spaces that activate a certain goal

"Concerning Hobbits" = credits song
